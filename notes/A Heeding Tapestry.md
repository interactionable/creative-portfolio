description: "A Heeding Tapestry is a crowdsourced typographic artwork and multimedia installation created by the SEADS collective for the Zomerspoor Festival in Belgium. The piece assembles short responses to a single speculative prompt: “How would you explain to an artificially created life form the concept of ‘ancestry’?” I contributed a bilingual (English and Filipino) response included in both the physical and digital versions of the tapestry."

# A Heeding Tapestry and Continuum [Group exhibit] (Zomerspoor Festival, 2023)

A Heeding Tapestry is a crowdsourced typographic artwork and multimedia installation created by the SEADS collective for the Zomerspoor Festival in Belgium. The piece assembles short responses to a single speculative prompt: “How would you explain to an artificially created life form the concept of ‘ancestry’?” I contributed a bilingual (English and Filipino) response included in both the physical and digital versions of the tapestry. Alongside this, my interactive sculpture Continuum—a tactile kinetic work exploring deep time and somatic sensing—was also exhibited during the same festival as part of the SEADS program.
