  Ekosi Eksi is an homage to the bony vertebrae of the spine, and to the skin, muscle, fascia that surround it. Influenced by the phenomenon of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and ASMR artists, the film is also an experiment in using the combination of sound and the moving image to create bodily responses specifically localised in the spine of audience members.
