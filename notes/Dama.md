title: Dama
description: Dama is a new iteration of my Haplos wearable technology, reimagined in a glove form. It explores how carefully designed patterns of gentle vibration can enhance body awareness, support sensorimotor learning, and open up new possibilities for rehabilitation and creative practice. Building on the original Haplos project, Dama translates vibrotactile feedback into the intimate context of the hand, offering a prototype that gestures toward future applications in health, design, and embodied experience.
