# Paint With Your Efforts

In this installation led by designer and PhD student Pat Subyen at the 2010 Surrey Arts Centre e-mixer, we demonstrate EffortDetect—a Laban Effort recognition system—as well as the movement quality visualizer, LVIZ, that Pat had built. I built a glove that could house the sensor and other hardware that interfaces with EffortDetect. We were pretty happy with the results, and people seemed to enjoy playing with the system. There was also a looping video of a slideshow presentation created by Pat, and which was shown with the installation.
