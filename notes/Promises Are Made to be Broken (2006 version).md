title: Promises Are Made to be Broken (2006 version)
description: |-
  In 2006, I worked with Mae Bayot, Jay Cruz, Tess Jamias, Regina Lasam, and Donna Miranda on Promises Are Made to be Broken, one of the most unusual and emotionally-intrusive performance pieces I had ever worked on. After forcibly making audience members partner us dancing (while we performers were blindfolded!), we scheduled romantic dates with them that, as the title suggests, we weren’t obliged to keep. Having just spent ten years in Vancouver, where art in general (and dance in particular) tended to be considerably more tame, the experience of rehearsing and performing this was an interesting jolt to my system. 
  Acrobats of love, cynical and vulnerable at the same time, six warm bodies seek to tell the stories of their bodies by evoking frustration of attention, interrupting choreographic-driven material with improvisation. Offering glimpses into brief episodes of challenged reality, broken continuities and unabridged circumstances. In this adventure Donna Miranda invites conspirators Dancing Wounded’s Jay Cruz, Mae Bayot and Regina Lasam along with Tess Jamias and Diego Maranan to temporarily disrupt the sociology of a cafe environment. Using spoken word, text, gestures and movement, the artists are enjoined to paint the grotesque of seduction and frustration, much like the idea of performing before an audience. How to “install” our bodies in the gallery/cafe space and allow a narrative to take shape? What happens when we heighten the ordinary under artificial conditions, prolonging the pregnant glances and risk to move beyond the accepted? A performance is like an adventure, to drop out of the continuity of life, cutting out a piece of endless continuous sequences of perceived experience, detaching it from all connectives and giving it self-sufficient form (thank you Georg Simmel).
