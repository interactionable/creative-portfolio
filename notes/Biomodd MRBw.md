title: Biomodd MRBw
description: The Biomodd [MRBw] workshop led by Diego Maranan and Angelo Vermeulen and was part of the KIBLIX Festival and the International Computer Arts Festival in Maribor, Slovenia, 2010. This Biomodd version, that visually resembles an impressive tower, consisted out of computers cases that were stacked in a spiral. The components were mounted on the exterior, turning the interior into the exterior. Within the tower there were seven computers up and running that had a game installed on all of them. Just like previous Biomodd’s an algae-cooled motherboard was an important part. However unlike previous mods, the cooling tubes were suspended above the ground and extended for several meters, encroaching into a gallery space just next to the workshop space. The system for watering plants was built at the top of the tower using syringes and IV drips. An extra component that was featured in this Biomodd was a satellite installation near a window that was composed of two computers, two webcams, a monitor, and a TV. One webcam captured video of the workshop space and sent it to the monitor, which was on the window and was facing the street, so spectators could watch the Biomodd being built live. The other webcam scanned the window ledge in a sweeping motion, monitoring the plants and the computer components on the ledge, and sent the video to the TV, which was facing the workshop space. We also fed the sound of the aerating algae into the TV, giving Biomodd for the first time a sound. The workshop resulted in an installation piece that was exhibited at KIBLA.
