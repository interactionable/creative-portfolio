# Establishment of the Bukas Lab space, UPOU

Along with craftsman and carpenter Joey Espinosa, I designed the interior of the Bukas Lab space. Using low-cost and often recycled materials, we turned one of the offices UP Open University into a creative space for hosting programs including the Wearable Futures Hackathon.
