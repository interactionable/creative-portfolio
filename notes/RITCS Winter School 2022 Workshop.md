title: RITCS Winter School 2022 Workshop
description: At the invitation of the Royal Institute for Theatre, Cinema and Sound (RITCS) in Brussels, I co-designed and led a two-week interdisciplinary workshop as part of RITCS Winter School 2022. The program invited international guests to work with RITCS students across cinema, sound, and theatre to respond to a central theme—the tensions between climate change and the new space race. Our SEADS-led workshop encouraged students to explore radical ambiguity, embodied research, and multisensory prototyping in imagining speculative futures.
